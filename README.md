# Password manager

Password Manager, as it names say, is a password managment application that aims to help you to use different and secure passwords and remind them for you.

It's a project I made to learn python, and wxpython (I will probably move to flask), and a project I will use when it gain in maturity.

The application is not finished yet, so I grantly discourage you to use it if it's not for testing it.

For now, the application generate secured password, and store a crypted version of them, but the key used to encrypt is available in a text file, so I need to find a way to fix this.

## Features

- A random and secure password creation
- An easy to use interface


## Roadmap

- The posibility to remove or update password

- Add the posibility to write custom password, to match some strange site rules

- Secure the key

- Add installation instruction of the application
